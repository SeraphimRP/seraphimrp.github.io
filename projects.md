My best and primary project is [BibleBot](https://biblebot.xyz) ([GitHub](https://github.com/BibleBot)), a Discord bot for referencing the Bible and other Christian resources. It serves over 6,000 servers with a combined audience of over 400,000 users.

My secondary project is canon_law ([GitHub](https://github.com/vypr/canon_law)), which is a web service for referencing Orthodox canon law. It is not yet finished but all that is lacking is the rest of the content.

The only tertiary project at the moment is goarch_api ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/goarch-api/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/vypr/goarch_api)), a Python interface for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America's Chapel API. I will have more similar projects in the future.
