My legal name is Elliott Pardee. However, I use my (to-be) confirmation name, Solanus. I'm 20 years old. I live in my hometown, Port Huron, MI. I am a Catholic inquirer, aspiring computer scientist, and aspiring servant of Christ.

## Projects

My best and primary project is [BibleBot](https://biblebot.xyz) ([GitHub](https://github.com/BibleBot)), a Discord bot for referencing the Bible and other Christian resources. It serves over 6,000 servers with a combined audience of over 400,000 users.

My secondary project is canon_law ([GitHub](https://github.com/vypr/canon_law)), which is a web service for referencing Orthodox canon law. It is not yet finished but all that is lacking is the rest of the content.

The only tertiary project at the moment is goarch_api ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/goarch-api/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/vypr/goarch_api)), a Python interface for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America's Chapel API. I will have more similar projects in the future.


## Trivia

### Personality

My type on the *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator* seems to be around **[ISTP](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/91f653537feab)**. My last two indicators are in the middle, so I can also be in the range of **ISTJ, ISFP, or ISFJ**. On the *Enneagram*, I seem to be **6w5 (Enneagram 6 with a Five-Wing)**. For the *Big 5 Personality Inventory*, I received the following scores: **Openness to Experience: 3.0/5.0 (60%), Conscientiousness: 3.0/5.0 (60%), Extraversion: 3.4/5.0 (68%), Agreeableness: 4.1/5.0 (82%), Neuroticism: 3.1/5.0 (62%)**

I would describe my disposition in life as **optimistic realism**. I hope for the best in all things, however I am able to realize whether people or events will act in a certain way due to certain circumstances.

I prefer **colder temperatures over hotter ones**, I will typically keep temperatures around **62-70&deg; F (16-21&deg; C / 289-294&deg; K)**. Preferred vacation spots include **forests, mountains, and anything in between**.

### Religion/Theology

As mentioned earlier, I am a **Catholic inquirer**. After some discernment, I believe my patron saint is **Blessed Solanus Casey**, whose name I will take after and whose life I will strive to imitate. **Blessed Solanus, pray for me.**

Next is my **theological stances**. This doesn't go too deep beyond general theology, but if I find ever a need to add more, I'll be sure to do so.

In terms of **soteriology** and how that comes about, I agree with the Apostolic churches in the belief of **synergism** and the **salvation process outlined by St. John Cassian**. While God certainly makes the first move (and that a person cannot), it is required for salvation to cooperate with Him. I affirm **unlimited and unconditional election**, but **I do not affirm total depravity or any other related ideas**.

I believe the Bible is **infallible** in matters of doctrine, historical account (Genesis before Abraham aside), and moral teaching. However, I have seen evidence for both sides of inerrancy and I can't find myself to make a reasonable conclusion without contradiction.

On **gifts of the Holy Spirit**, I am **continuationist**. However, this does not mean that the average person can start speaking in tongues immediately following conversion. Gifts of the Holy Spirit are more prevalent through sanctification, as we see with many saints having the gift of prophesy.

In regards to how I feel about a **literal millennium**, I am **amillennialist**. Nonetheless, I do find myself **sympathetic to postmillennialism**.

Finally, the issue dividing the Oriental churches from the rest: **Christology**. I find both miaphysitism and Chalcedon's definition to be agreeing with each other, but from different perspectives. Language use aside, I have found no disagreement with Orientals about Christology.

### Music

I would consider myself an **audiophile** in the sense that music plays a very important role in my life. It feels as though I've had a soundtrack to my life, and I associate songs to various times in my life when I had listened to them the most.

While I listen to many genres, the majority of what I listen to ends up somewhere around **metal, post-hardcore, punk, post-/grunge, hip hop, and electronic** music.

My favorite artists from different genres, but still keeping it broad:

- Heavy metal: Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed
- Metalcore: Killswitch Engage, early Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet For My Valentine
- Nu metal: Linkin Park, Slipknot
- Other rock: My Chemical Romance, Rise Against, Dope, The Offspring, Crossfade, Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Foo Fighters, Three Days Grace, Megadeth, Anthrax
- Hip hop: Kendrick Lamar, Logic, J. Cole, Eminem, Kid Cudi, Chance The Rapper, Childish Gambino, Atmosphere, Macklemore, Lil Dicky, Run The Jewels
- Electronic: deadmau5, Daft Punk, Haywyre, Swedish House Mafia, Knife Party, Stromae

Being musically-inclined, I also play **bass guitar** and am learning **electric guitar and piano**. I own a **Ibanez SoundGear SR300EB** bass and a **Ibanez GIO GS171** guitar. I record using **Ableton Live 10** and a **Blue Snowball** microphone. I also try my hand at producing hip hop beats, where I use VSTs like **Massive, Serum, and Reaktor**.

Here are some songs that I've produced:
