My best and primary project is [BibleBot](https://biblebot.xyz) ([GitHub](https://github.com/biblebot/biblebot)), a Discord bot for referencing the Bible and other Christian resources. It serves over 30,000 servers with a combined audience of over 1.1 million users. I've founded a non-profit around the project, [Kerygma Digital](https://kerygma.digital), that seeks to provide similar services in an open-source manner.

My secondary project is canon_law ([GitHub](https://github.com/HesychiaDiscord/canon_law)), a web service for referencing Orthodox canon law. It is not yet finished but all that is lacking is the rest of the content.

The only tertiary project at the moment is goarch_api ([GitHub](https://github.com/HesychiaDiscord/goarch_api)), a Python interface for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America's Chapel API. I will have more similar projects in the future.

I am also a volunteer Software Engineer at [Catena](http://catenabible.com), a Bible application featuring Patristics commentaries and lectionary readings. I incorporated the Greek Orthodox lectionary into the app along with daily quotes from saints.
