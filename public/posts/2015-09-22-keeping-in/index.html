  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>It&rsquo;s been a long 3 months since I&rsquo;ve updated on all this education stuff. When I wrote the post, I had reached my low point and I wasn&rsquo;t sure where I was headed afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>But now, I&rsquo;m back.</strong></p>
<p>When I wrote that blog post, I had dropped out of the online school I had chosen and made a small effort towards getting my GED. It wasn&rsquo;t working so I just started playing by ear and seeing where life takes me.</p>
<p>I was going to counseling appointments bi-weekly and eventually seeing a psychiatrist to give me the final verdict on my depression. Turns out, I did enter a depression (which I&rsquo;m still in process of fixing). The medicine is helping so I just kept playing by ear, since the school year was over and I didn&rsquo;t really have much to do. The GED wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted and was a last resort thing (if that wasn&rsquo;t apparent).</p>
<p>The appointments were starting to get a little bit annoying. It&rsquo;s different when it&rsquo;s a routine, but when it&rsquo;s every other week it starts to get a bit repetitive. My insurance only covered so many appointments and I ended up having to spend these next 4 months with only 2 appointments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially a good and bad thing. Good as in, I&rsquo;m on my way to healing and the medicine is helping to where the appointments aren&rsquo;t necessary. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m done yet with the medication, as my mood has a definite change when I fail to take them on a day. It&rsquo;s bad in the sense that if I was to ever slip back, I&rsquo;d be screwed. There wouldn&rsquo;t be much I could do and I&rsquo;d just have to survive. The plus side is that me slipping back seems slim now.</p>
<p>A short time after I had my appointments spread across the months, I received a phone call from an online school that I applied to back in January when I had signed up for the other one. The benefits of this online school being:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s in my area.</li>
<li>I go to an actual school, despite all of it being online.</li>
<li>Partially oriented around people like myself. They inquired about me wanting to join, and I said yes. It was the only good thing I had going for me and I took it. Since it couldn&rsquo;t get much worse than nothing. So, skip a few months later (because I didn&rsquo;t start until September). I go to school, and it is pretty direct and simple. They give you classes oriented around you (in addition to keeping state requirements) and making school less of a nuisance (I haven&rsquo;t received a piece of homework).</li>
</ol>
<p>I started school on September 15th (last week) and I was on my way. They start everyone with a math strategies elective class just to bring people up to speed on basic math and pre-algebra concepts. I finished the class today (September 22nd). I spent less than a real full school week (since we don&rsquo;t get Fridays and the school year starts on Tuesday). Granted, there was stuff that I had to learn, but I had about 30-40% of the work like the back of my hand, and I was able to finish the rest quickly once I was taught.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the first one to finish a class in this school year.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m starting to get to the top, like I should&rsquo;ve been. I&rsquo;m also at the point where I&rsquo;m looking at the present and very near future and I&rsquo;m not looking back on the past. <strong>That&rsquo;s over.</strong></p>
<p>Hell, if I finish classes within weeks, I&rsquo;d be out sooner before my normal time.</p>
<p>So, my friends and family, including the strangers on the internet (who supported me regardless with no doubt), <strong>thank you</strong>. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the support I had received, I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;d bother trying for my education. So (1000 * &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;) to each and everyone of you to motivated me to get to where I needed to be,</p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
