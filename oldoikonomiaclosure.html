	<h1>R.I.P. Oikonomia, an Orthodox Christian Community</h1>
	<h2>2018-2019</h2>

	<hr>

    <small>February 19th, 2019</small>

	<p>As a lot of you already know, Oikonomia was deleted. This was not by Discord, as some might speculate, but rather myself personally. While the decision to delete was capricious, the feelings and environment necessary for me to do that were very much there. Allow me to explain.</p>

	<p>Oikonomia was founded somewhere around February/March 2018. In its formation, it was intended to be a low-to-medium sized server for Orthodox, even more so for people who were Orthodox and likeminded with mimi_jean. It remained this way up until late August/early September 2018 when Mimi transferred ownership to me following the growth of traditionalist members on the server and the "schism" of sorts in the creation of Leitourgia. What you saw in Oikonomia the last week of its existence is very far from the original intention. Many, especially TheTiger0502 and Shiranui117, can attest to this.</p>

	<p>I involved myself in Oikonomia's administration and development from the beginning. I had abandoned the already-dying Christcord Origin, handing it over to Tiger to focus on Oikonomia. I saw a great potential for the server and through my administration, I made sure that it would be realized. What I saw for Oikonomia was definitely not what Mimi saw for Oikonomia, which would result in many personal conflicts over positions of power. I saw Oikonomia as this community that had the potential to be a powerful force for Orthodoxy on the internet, Mimi wanted a group of likeminded individuals. As you can see in the end, I got my way. Mimi's departure from ownership gave me the perfect opportunity to force Oikonomia in this growth, but it did not come easily.</p>

	<p>Since Mimi and I had differing goals for the server, the server up until September 2018 was a mix of these goals. The server had grown quite significantly and became a common name among Christian Discords, but with Mimi's intent for likemindedness, it had a significant amount of those who would lean theologically liberal. These two in combination allowed for Oikonomia to develop the reputation that it did. If you mentioned Oikonomia to someone around September 2018, most would have disdain for it and would have very reactionary viewpoints about it. Thus, when I became owner I had a lot of work on my hands, but that was alright.</p>

	<p>Being this in-between of open to modern theological stances and traditionalism, I had no problem letting the growth of traditionalism occur in the server. In fact, I encouraged it not only in my words but in my administration of the server. Of course, this did not come without resistance. I was labeled a Nazi sympathizer by the modernists for the permittance of Nazis in the server, a modernist by the traditionalists for the forbiddance of using specific terms that were often targeted and thrown at the LGBT. I looked to please everyone and provide a more moderate server where respect for persons and viewpoints was given universally. Unfortunately, this would never occur during Oikonomia's lifetime.</p>

	<p>Traditionalism had got to the point in the server where those who were traditional would purposefully instigate those who disagreed. Catholics, unless favoring Orthodoxy, didn't stand much of a chance, resulting in the departure of many members such as Jcfraven and vote4waifu. Rather than being a helping hand with Orthodoxy, the server had become a wall for those who were sliding away from it. You know who you are. I am very much complicit as well, as I allowed it to occur in order to please the majority. To anyone who Oikonomia has hurt, I pray that you can forgive me for allowing it.</p>

	<p>Nearing the end, Oikonomia was starting to stagnate and further itself as an echochamber of the traditional. Tribalism was very much growing and there are only so little ways to fix that without kicking everyone out and starting from square one.</p>

	<p>I loved Oikonomia, it was one of the few reasons why I woke up in the morning, and it's impacted my life in so many ways that I'm grateful for.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>Unfortunately, it is not only Oikonomia itself that has led to this. My mental state is seemingly deteriorating by the day. That day when I started spamming and I changed my name and image, giving myself all roles. Your fears were correct, I was losing it. I managed to play the situation to where people wouldn't be alarmed or concerned because the last thing I needed was more pressure. What you saw that day was a cry for help.</p>

	<p>My situation at home is only getting worse. My parents' frustration with my behavior is growing and I haven't felt more isolated from the world than I have now. Not mentioning the pressure of having only a year to figure out my life and avoid getting kicked out. I want to protest so badly against my family but without a single physical advocate here, I'm only digging the hole deeper by doing so. I'm stuck in a rock and a hard place and the future is uncertain. What I do know is that I'm not going anywhere and I will endure my sufferings, whether through sorrow or gladness. Kyrie, eleison.</p>

	<p>As for what happens next, that is yet to be determined. Mimi has created a server with more of the original intent of Oikonomia represented, a small group of friends. As for myself, I would like to focus on creating a more privatized community with a narrower focus. A lot is still to be determined with what I will be doing, but if you guys are interested in being involved in what I'll eventually do, let me know.</p>

	<p>I cannot recommend anyone create a clone of Oikonomia nor try to make a community in its stead and I have advised a majority of former staff to not endorse such as well. Oikonomia was destined to fall, either by implosion, through Discord deleting it for reasons which you guys would know about, or through my deletion of it. If I saw Oikonomia surviving, I would've handed it off to someone else, but I know no one who could put in the time and effort in Oikonomia than I could. Not to be boastful, but I found myself the only one fit to run it.</p>

	<p>It brings me sorrow to create disappointment among you all, but I can only pray that you understand how it got to this point.<br><br>May you forgive me. I'll answer any questions on Discord DMs.<br><b>- Seraphim (vypr#0001)</b></p>
