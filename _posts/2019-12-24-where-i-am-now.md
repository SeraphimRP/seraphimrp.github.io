Greetings, everyone. It's been a while.

As you might've read or noticed, these past few years have been all over the place. I won't get into details too greatly like my usual blog posts, because they will no longer be my usual blog posts. What I can say though, is that I'm doing better. Not much better, but better nonetheless.

An update is warranted on everything that's happened and what'll be happening from now. For starters, I'm no longer going to blog about my life for now. While it was a good outlet during some of my darkest times, it's no longer fulfilling and I end up neglecting more than writing. That being said, I won't be cutting off myself from writing about my life completely. I've decided to opt for journaling. This way, I can give myself the opportunity to have everything that this blogging experience has alongside the privacy allowing me to be more direct in my writing. If I used names here as much as I do in my journal, I'm sure it would be read and spread rather quickly. This way, I can be personal. The likelihood of someone reading it is slim, and if they did it would be within certain parameters I'm comfortable with.

Secondly, I've converted to Eastern Orthodoxy and I'm currently a catechumen. Long past is my years of Buddhism and my time in Lutheranism. Study and prayer has led me to what I know is Christ's Church, and I won't turn back.

Thirdly, I did leave college for a short while following a full-time job I had with Walmart. I work at Planet Fitness part-time and so it has given me the opportunity to study computer science at Southern New Hampshire University with my girlfriend. I'm still on the up with that, promise.

I'm not sure whether I will keep this blog, frankly. In an ideal world, I would like to use this blog to talk about more technical matters like my adventures with Fedora Linux and other things. However, as you might already be aware, I'm not very good at keeping up with this.

We'll see what happens.
